        <h2>1. About</h2>
        <p>With U-Notes you can easily share your knowledge about your University subjects and modules with your fellow students. It is very easy to use this website and this manual will help you with any possible problems you might encounter while using the U-Notes website.</p>
        <p>You simply choose a module you are interested in, and once you create your own account, you can start creating collaborative notes documents to share your experience and knowledge with other people. You can also modify documents that were created by someone else. If you have a problem you cannot solve and you need help, you can simply ask a question in the Q&А´s page of the relevant module. Once you do so, everyone is able to see your question and registered users can answer to your question or discuss any problems. </p>
       <br><br>
       
        <h2>2. Account</h2>
        <p>This section describes how you can create your own account, manage it and log into it.</p>
        
        <h3>2.1. Create an account</h3> 
        <p>On the main page you can see a brief description of the system and in the top part of the page you can see a panel with <strong>Register</strong> button. Once you click this button, a new page opens up with a form for you to fill out. The form has a few required fields, such as an Email address, which can be used as your username, and password. Other fields like what degree you are/were studying, something about yourself you want to share with other users and an avatar, a small picture that represents your account, are optional fields and do not need to be filled out.</p>
        <p>Once you are done with filling out the form, you can click the <strong>Register</strong> button to submit your details. The system afterwards informs you about an email being sent to the Email address you filled out in the form, which contains a confirmation link. Open the received email with your Email client and click on the link in the body of the email. This opens a new page informing you that the registration and confirmation of your account has been successful.</p>
        <p>You can also use an external server to log in. In the registration page you can see Facebook and Google+ buttons on the right. If you wish to log in using your details of an existing account on an external server, you simply click the button of the corresponding social network.
        <br>
        
        <h3>2.2. Log in and out</h3>
        <p>Once you are done with successful creation of your account, you are ready to use it and to log into it by pressing the <strong>Log in</strong> button on the top of any page. A new page opens after you clicked the button and you are asked to fill in your email address used as a username and your password. You can also tick the <Strong>Remember me</Strong> option for the website to log you in automatically whenever you access it. Once you fill out the credentials and submit them, you are informed whether you have been successfully logged in to the system or not.
        <br>
        If you wish to log yourself out of the system, click the <strong>Log out</strong> button on top of any page on the right. The page refreshes after you click it and you are not logged in the system anymore.</p>
        
        <h3>2.3. Manage your account</h3>
        <p>When you are done with creating your account, you are able to change any information stored in it. You can do so by clicking the button with your username on top of any page and you get redirected to a new page. This new page shows you all the information that is held in your account and next to it you can see <strong>Change</strong> clickable links. If you wish to change your password, you click on the link saying <strong>Change</strong> next to the password and a new page opens up. This page requires you to fill out your old password together with your new password and confirm changes by pressing the <strong>Submit</strong> button below the form.</p>
        <p>This process is the same for any other information you wish to change in your profile.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Getting started</h2>
        <p>After you are done with creating your profile, you are ready to start using the U-Notes website. This part of the manual will explain what are all the pages in the system for and how you as a user can interact with them.</p>
        
        <h3>3.1. Main Page</h3>
        <p>The main page is the first page that opens up once you register or log in to your account. It contains a short description of the website and in the bottom half of the screen you can see list of all available modules registered within the system. Once you choose one and click it, a new page, a <strong>Module page</strong> is opened.</p>
        
        <h3>3.2. Module Page</h3>
        <p>In this page you can see the name and description of the chosen module and in the bottom half of the screen you can see two lists. The first list is a list of the most recently added and changed collaborative notes documents related to this module. You can either click on one document name to open it in the <strong>Notes page</strong>, or you can view the full list of the documents by clicking on the <strong>Open a complete list of notes</strong> link. This opens up a <strong>NotesList page</strong>.
        If you wish to create a new document, you can achieve that by clicking on the <strong>Create a document</strong> button right next to the list of all documents, which opens a <strong>Create a Notes Document Page</strong>.</p>
        <p>The second list in this page, right in the bottom of it, is a list of the most recent Q&A documents. Similarly as with the list of notes documents, you can either choose one Q&A topic to open it up in the <strong>Q&A page</strong>, view the full list of the topics by clicking on the <strong>Open a complete list of Q&A´s </strong> or you can go to the <strong>Create Q&A page</strong> by clicking on the <strong>Ask a question</strong> button next to the list.</p>
        
        <h3>3.3. List of Q&A´s and notes pages</h3>
        <p>Those two pages look exactly the same and have the same purpose- show the full list of the documents in the system to allow you to browse through them and choose whichever one you want to view or modify.</p>
        
        <h3>3.4. Q&A Page</h3>
        <p>This page contains the question on the top of the page, that has been asked by a user in the system. All answers for the question are shown below it and you can also answer the question yourself by clicking in the white text area in the bottom of the screen. That allows you to format your answer however you wish in order for it to be as understandable as possible. You submit your answer by clicking on the <strong>Submit answer</strong> button.</p>
        
        <h3>3.5. Create a Question Page</h3>
        <p>This page opens up if you clicked on the <strong>Ask a question</strong> button in the <strong>Module Page</strong>. On this page you can see two text areas, where the first one is the title of the question you want to ask and the second one is for the description of the problem you are having and want help with. Once you are done with explaining your problem, click on the <strong>Submit question</strong> button in order to submit it and preview your newly created question in the <strong>Q&A Page</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3>3.6. Notes Page</h3>
        <p>This page contains one document created by a registered user of the system. You can either just read the document and use it for your studies or any other purpose, or you can click on the <strong>Edit</strong> button in order to open this document in a new page, which allows you to modify the document. When you are done with the modifications, you can save and submit the changes you have made by pressing the <strong>Save and submit</strong> button, or you can discard the changes by pressing the <strong>Cancel and go back</strong> button. When you submit your changes, you can see the modified document in a new page.</p>
        <h3>3.7. Create a Notes Document Page</h3>
        <p>In this page you can create a new document by writing the text in the text area and submitting the document by pressing the <strong>Save and submit</strong> button underneath it. Once the document is created, it is opened in a new page and from that moment on, all users registered in the system are able to view and modify the document.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Ready to go</h2>
        <p>If you read this manual and followed the actual pages in the system, you are ready to use it fully and should not encounter any problems while using it as it was designed to be as intuitive and user friendly as possible.</p>
